Intro
-----
Peepcoin is a free open source project derived from Bitcoin, 
with the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient scrypt-based crypto-currency. 
Built on the foundation of Bitcoin using the Libzerocoin extention, 
Peepcoin was Proof-Of-Work until August 2016, 
then it became pure Proof-Of-Stake. 

The original developer abandoned the coin, 
in February 2018 a new Peepcoin team was created 
with the goal of rebranding and swapping Peepcoin. 
The "DAPS" Team consists of ex-Peepcoin community members and new developers, 
working to build Peepcoin into a more modern coin prior to a swap to DAPS. 
This will include an upgrade of Peepcoin wallets released under official DAPS sources.

All DAPS Team products are fully vetted, secure, 
and created by fully ID'd members of the crypto community. 
Only the official DAPScoin Github repo will have this guarantee. 
Any Documentation, readme, fork, or otherwise exclusing 
this notice should be considered unofficial.
